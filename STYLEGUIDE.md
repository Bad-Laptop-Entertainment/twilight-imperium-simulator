If you know PEP8, use PEP8. Otherwise, Google's style guide is a much quicker read: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html.

The Code Commandments:
1) Write clean code
2) Write comments
3) Describe the git changes in your push
4) Use docstrings and type hints
5) Use good variable names

Please use git etiquette such as trailing commas on multiline arguments. This helps with only flagginhg the lines that got changed.
eg. my_function(
        foo,
        bar,
        baz, # <--- trailing comma
    )

Folders and files are named as such: folder-name, file-name.ext
